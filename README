Python3 / tkinter implementation of Conway's Game Of Life
by Szymon Jakubiak

Tested in Python 3.2.3

1. Configuration

It is possible to configure following simulation parameters by editing
constants in the header of GameOfLife.py file:

* size of the game window which is determined by number of cells
diagonally (WORLD_WIDTH) and vertically (WORLD_HEIGHT) as well as size
of single cell in pixels (CELL_SIZE)

* behavior of cells at window boarder: if ROUND_WORLD has value True cells
from first column / row will interact with cells from last column / row,
what for example allows ship to fly around the world; if ROUND_WORLD has value
False boarder of the screen is counted as dead cell
